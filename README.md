PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project focuses on automating the process of reading data from structured files (e.g., CSV, Excel, or JSON), performing analysis, and generating a professional PDF report. The script processes raw data, extracts key insights (such as averages, trends, or summaries), and automatically formats them into a well-structured PDF document.

Using libraries like ReportLab or FPDF, the PDF report includes headings, tables, charts, and summaries, making it suitable for business reporting, academic analysis, or automated documentation. This reduces manual effort, ensures consistency, and enables quick reporting from large datasets.


TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Python – core programming language

Pandas – for data cleaning and analysis

Matplotlib / Seaborn – for generating charts and graphs

ReportLab / FPDF – for creating formatted PDF reports

NumPy (optional) – for numerical computations

CSV/Excel/JSON – as input data formats


OBJECTIVES:

Automate the process of generating professional PDF reports.

Read and analyze raw data from external files.

Present key insights (summaries, stats, and trends) in a structured format.

Embed tables, charts, and textual analysis in the final PDF.

Save time and reduce human error in repetitive reporting tasks
